# This is a plugin for minecraft that does a bit if trolling

## TODO List:
* Falling out of world sends to superflat world
* Mess up villager trades
* Nether fortress more difficult
* Big blazes
* Dropped item(s) changed
* Coal crafting recipes different

## Testing Required
* Inventory Randomizer
** Implimented when the player moves, the chance for things to be randomized needs to be changed to be more reasonable, but what that is needs testing to figure out.
